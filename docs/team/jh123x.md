## Project: McGymmy

McGymmy is a desktop diet tracker application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to import and export files.
  * What it does: allows the user to import and export McGymmy save files.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can transfer their data to other McGymmy programs.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects future updates to food items if more attributes are to be added.
  * Credits: *JavaFX Documentation*
