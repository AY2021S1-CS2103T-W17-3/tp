* McGymmy is a CLI based application for sedentary software engineers to manage their diet and stay healthy.
  * The CLI aspect of the application is benefits the target audience (software engineers), as it is something often used by them.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[McGymmy Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-3.github.io/tp/)**.
